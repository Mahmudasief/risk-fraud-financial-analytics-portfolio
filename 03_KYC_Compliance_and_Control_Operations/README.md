# KYC Compliance & Control Operations (Case 3)

## Case Snapshot
**Domain:** KYC, Customer Due Diligence (CDD), and Compliance Operations  
**Tools:** Excel (control checklists, decision rules), SOP documentation  
**Focus:** Risk-based KYC decisioning, governance consistency, audit defensibility  

## Objective
The objective of this case is to demonstrate how KYC and CDD controls are applied in a real-world compliance environment, with emphasis on documentation discipline, policy-driven escalation, and regulator-ready decision logic rather than analytics or dashboards.

## KYC Control Framework
This case simulates the onboarding review of a high-risk business customer using a structured KYC framework covering:
- Entity and jurisdiction verification  
- Ownership structure and UBO transparency  
- Adverse media and reputational risk  
- Source of funds vs. source of wealth  
- Business reasonableness and activity alignment  

Each control is evaluated with explicit outcomes (Pass / Review / Escalate) aligned to defined internal policies.

## Escalation & EDD Logic
Escalation decisions are not discretionary. Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) is triggered based on aggregation-based rules when multiple high-risk indicators are present, ensuring consistent and defensible outcomes across analysts.

## Documentation & Governance
Supporting Excel workpapers capture control-level results, analyst notes, and final risk disposition. A separate High-Risk Entity Verification Guide (SOP) documents standardized investigative procedures to ensure consistency, auditability, and governance reliability.

## Why This Matters
In real AML and compliance programs, weak KYC processes — not just risky customers — create regulatory exposure. This case demonstrates how strong upfront KYC controls reduce downstream monitoring noise, support audit readiness, and enable scalable compliance operations.

## Portfolio Context
This case represents the governance foundation of the financial crime lifecycle and complements:
- **Case 1:** Transaction investigation and alert review  
- **Case 2:** Risk scoring and operational analytics  

Together, these cases illustrate an end-to-end AML workflow from onboarding controls to escalation and risk decisioning.
